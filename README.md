# QR Codes on Tickets System with Payment
The project is a website that can scan, identify and process a virtual ticket in a closed loop scenario by creating a virtual profile (Service Provider Account + Customer Account).
A service provider creates an account, and generates a QR Code holding ticket info (first name, last name, date, location, price, Service provider ID) and pays the ticket through an open source payment platform.
A customer creates an account, and scans the QR Code via file upload.  

# Assumptions
1. Assume that there are only two users, one customer and one provider.
2. Assume that the ticket price is generated randomly for every transaction payment.
3. Assume the payment card number is “4242424242424242” and the expired date is “12/21”.

# Database Schema
The system has MySQL DataBase called “qrcode” contains one table “user” which contains data of the user like: First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, Type (Customer, Service Provider).

    This page is used to login to the website where both customer and service provider users can login to the website.
